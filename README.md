# CurriculumVitae
The latest version of my CV, powered by LaTeX and TikZ.

## Style
This CV template is designed to be minimalistic and professional (depending on a colourscheme of b&w with only one additional colour), while still showing off LaTeX and TikZ skills.

Furthermore, the template is extremely customisable, and heavily commented in the preamble to facilitate this. Feel free to contact me if you encounter any issues while customising!

## Building
To build the .pdf files, simply run

    $ pdflatex "Slađan Kantar - Curriculum Vitae.tex"

in any terminal, while in the root directory of this repository.

## Sample output
The latest compiled version of my CV as seen in this repository will always be stored at [my personal website](http://skantar.com/SladjanKantar-CurriculumVitae.pdf).
